# Manual

Here you can find some files with implementation of the app. To make code more flexible, implementation of descriptors was hided in distinct module descriptors.py. It hepls make users don't take care about subtleties under the hood, but just import any descriptors out from module to put them to classifier. As mentioned in the root directory README, classifier is necessary to distinguish either frames with special object and without it. First you need to fit a model. Once you do it, you can pick fitted model object repeatedly or refit it. By the way, we leave fitted model object in pickle file, this is trained to detect img in img.jpg. To train model for your own marker, you need to have photo sets with objects and without and give them to Classifier by method fit('path/to/dir/with/objects','path/to/dir/without/objects'). To make it easly, use scripts from scripts directory. Next step is running main.py. Just put any descriptor and classifier method from list to Classifier object as parameters and run program.

Results of working this program are inside results directory. Two videos demonstrate results of classifier work and one video demonstrates work of AR app(it replaces img.jpg to joint photo of developers team).
